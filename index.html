       <h1>Project outline</h1>
       <p>In our project, we used tools like collision/boundary detection, drawpad art, and if statements to make FROG ger. Collision/boundary detection was used to make it so that when the frog is hit by a truck, it resets the game. We used the same reset tool for how the player will win the game, by reaching the pond. We used drawpad to create the background for the game. Lastly, we used if statements to make the functions which checked the location of each of the trucks, the player, and the pond. In our project we used many tools to create our game, but these three were the most important and most commonly used.</p>Ied>

       <h1>Burn-down list</h1>
       <li><ul>-create frog and controls</li></ul>
       <li><ul>-create background "panels"</li></ul>
       <li><ul>-make the trucks</li></ul>
       <li><ul>-create collision detection so player and trucks cannot leave the screen.</li></ul>
       <li><ul>-create collision detection between the player and the trucks, and the player and the pond/end goal.</li></ul>

        <h1>Project Reflection</h1>
        <p>In our project, we used many tools and put a large amount of time and effort into our program. One of the hardest parts was coding for the elaborate things we planned on doing, such as resetting the game when the frog is hit by a truck or putting collision detection on EVERYTHING. The easiest part was creating the controls for the frog. Thanks to this project, I learned how to do collision detection and code for resetting the game using the player's coordinates and how to make enemies and allow them to move.</p>

       <h1>Screen Shots</h1>
       <img src="CAPTURE1.PNG" />
       <p>This screenshot shows the game as it starts. The hardest part was making the trucks move and doing the collision detection.</p>
       <img src="CAPTURE2.PNG" />
       <p>This screenshot shows how the player progresses throught the level (by now being ran over)</p>
       
       <h1>Code with an explanation</h1>
       <p>#background panels
       <p>Grass1 = drawpad.create_rectangle (0,0,150,500, fill= 'chartreuse')</p>
       <p>Road1 = drawpad.create_rectangle (150,0,250,500, fill= 'grey')</p>
       <p>Grass2 = drawpad.create_rectangle (250,0,350,500, fill= 'chartreuse')</p>
       <p>Road2 = drawpad.create_rectangle (350,0,450,500, fill= 'grey')</p>
       <p>Grass3 = drawpad.create_rectangle (450,0,550,500, fill= 'chartreuse')</p>
       <p>Road4 = drawpad.create_rectangle (550,0,650,500, fill= 'grey')</p>
       <p>Road5 = drawpad.create_rectangle (550,0,750,500, fill= 'grey')</p>
       <p>pond = drawpad.create_rectangle (750,0,900,500, fill= 'blue')</p>
       
       <p>What this code does is it creates the background for the game.</p>
